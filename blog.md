description: These notes and tutorials are meant to complement the material of Stanford’s class CS230 (Deep Learning) taught by Prof. Andrew Ng and Prof. Kian Katanforoosh. For questions / typos / bugs, use Piazza. These posts and this github repository give an optional structure for your final projects. Feel free to reuse this code for your final project, although you are expected to accomplish a lot more. You can also submit a pull request directly to our github.
